                While hotel stays are often uneventful, unexpected issues do arise. What matters most is how a hotel responds when things go wrong. Despite clear written acknowledgment of responsibility, Hotel Berchielli has failed to act. Travelers should be aware of this risk and consider alternative accommodations in Florence.

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>In July 2025 we stayed at Hotel Berchielli in Florence for two nights. The hotel is located near Ponte Vecchio, and because of local traffic restrictions, guests must rely on the hotel's valet service (Garage Florence Parking Firenze). We were instructed to hand over our car at Piazza di Santa Trinita and then walk to the hotel.</p>

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>At checkout, our rental car was returned to the piazza with a large scratch and bent panel on the front right side. I immediately notified hotel staff, who called the valet company. The valet reviewed security footage, which confirmed the damage was not present when the vehicle entered their garage.</p>

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>At my request, the valet company dictated a liability statement over the phone. A Hotel Berchielli representative wrote and signed this document, acknowledging that the damage occurred while the vehicle was in their custody.</p>
